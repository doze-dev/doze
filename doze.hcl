# doze.hcl — declarative local databases, no Docker.
#
# doze fetches real engine binaries, boots each declared instance on first
# connect, and reaps it when idle. For Postgres it converges the declared
# databases, schemas, roles/users, privileges, and extensions. It does NOT
# seed data or run migrations — your application owns those.
#
# Every instance pins its own port (doze never auto-assigns), so connection
# strings are stable. `doze env` prints them as eval-able exports.
#
# See README.md for the full reference.

# --- PostgreSQL -------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Local AWS (one engine, every service) ----------------------------------
# ONE block is the whole local AWS: S3, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, Lambda, KMS and the
# rest behind a single endpoint, with the web console at /_console. Declare the
# resources you want to exist; your app and its deploy tooling own the rest.
#
# `doze env` exports AWS_ENDPOINT_URL plus dummy creds and a region, so an
# unmodified AWS SDK or the `aws` CLI talks to it with no other change.

# --- Apps (no Docker) --------------------------------------------------------
# An `app` runs your code directly on the host, wired to the modules above by
# references. `doze up` boots the databases first, runs `setup` (migrations),
# starts the app, then waits for `ready` before streaming logs. Uncomment and
# point `dir` at a real app to try it.
#
# app "api" {
#   dir  = "../approvals-engine"
#   run  = "go run main.go -program api"
#   port = 8080
#
#   env = {
#     DATABASE_URL = module.app_dev.url   # a reference → boots app_dev first
#   }
#
#   setup = "go run main.go -program migrate -command up"
#   ready = http("/health/ready")
#
#   restart {
#     policy      = "on_failure"
#     max_retries = 5
#   }
# }
